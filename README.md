Weather Information that we are collecting: 

Wind,
Rain Chance,
Temperature,
Number of Visible Satallites,
Line of Sight,
Cloud Coverage


This will manage the communication with the weather APIs  (Model)   
`Weather_API.py`  


This file will include the weather model. Still thinking about this.   
`WeatherModel.py`   

This will control the weather logic, parsing & populating the widget  (Controller)  
`Controller.py`   

This will display the weather information  (View)  
`WeatherWidget.py`  


Weather APIs that we are planning to use:
